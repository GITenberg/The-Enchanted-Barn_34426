description: Shirley Hollister is faced with a harrowing situation. She, her ailing
  mother, and her younger brothers and sisters have been evicted from their small
  flat, which is slated for demolition. Desperate for a place to live, she rents and
  begins to refurbish an old barn. Amazed with her progress and pluck, the landlord,
  Sidney Graham, begins to take an interest in the family's well-being. Is it possible
  for love to flourish amidst such trying circumstances?
